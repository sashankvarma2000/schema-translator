3. Give it a name: `schema-translator-push`
4. Select scope: Check **"repo"** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

## After Successful Push

Visit your repository:
**https://github.com/sashankvarma2000/schema-translator**

You should see:
- ✅ All 78 files uploaded
- ✅ README.md displays correctly
- ✅ Complete project structure

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Navigate to export directory
cd /Users/sashank/Desktop/Sashank/girish/github_export

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Token must have "repo" scope

### "Permission denied"
- Verify repository URL is correct
- Make sure you have write access to the repository

### "Repository not found"
- Check that the repository exists at: https://github.com/sashankvarma2000/schema-translator
- Make sure you're logged into the correct GitHub account
